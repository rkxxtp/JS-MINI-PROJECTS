# Light Bulb On/Off Project 

A fun little project that lets you toggle a light bulb on and off with a switch! Itâ€™s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Whatâ€™s in the Box 
- **Toggle the Light**: Click the switch to turn the light bulb on and off.
- **Cool Animation**: Watch the light bulb light up and the background change smoothly when you toggle.
- **Responsive**: It looks great on both desktops and mobiles!

## How It Works ðŸ”§
1. **index.html**: The basic structure of the page with the bulb and switch.
2. **style.css**: All the cool styles that make the bulb light up and switch look nice.
3. **script.js**: The magic! It toggles the bulbâ€™s state when you click the switch.
